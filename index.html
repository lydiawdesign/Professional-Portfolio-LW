                <p>
                    Hi! My name is <strong>Lydia Williamson.</strong> I am an Website and Product Data Manager from Cincinnati, Ohio. I am the daughter of two architects. I graduated from the University of Dayton in December of 2017 with a degree in <strong>Communication with a concentration in Media Production</strong> and 2 minors - one in Visual Arts and the other in Business Administration. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I graduated, I’ve spent the last two years living abroad in Morocco. I’ve learned many things while living abroad like how to work with a diverse group of people, how to be resilient and strong, and how to market myself. My whole life I’ve been passionate about traveling, creating things, and art. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    My first ever job was when I was 15 and I was a lifeguard. I’ve come a long way since then with many different odd jobs and titles. From being a nanny to a receptionist, a waiter, a bartender, a barista, an art teacher, a mural painter, a graphic designer, Creative and Content Strategist, Marketing Coordinator, to my most recent title of Website and Product Data Manager at a Promotional Product Supplier. Each job has taught me a new set of skills and has helped me narrow my field and refine myself professionally. 
                </p>
                    
                    <p>
                   <strong>I thrive somewhere inbetween analytical and creative.</strong> I’m a creator and a curator by nature; I pride myself on my strong work ethic, my ability to find solutions, and my unique viewpoint. I am a passionate person who loves to learn and try new things. If I don’t know how to do something, I’m always the first one who wants to learn. I work well in a team environment (and find myself to be a leader typically) but I don’t mind taking on solo projects head-on. 
                </p>
